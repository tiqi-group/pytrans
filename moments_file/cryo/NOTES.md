# Info on model files for the Cryo setup

root = '/scratch/TrapSimulation_Karan'

All csv files here have been exported by Karan using RunOneElec.m and RunAllElecs.m
The trap axis is `x`

## Axial2QubitTrap_xline_DC[1..10]x0-0.csv

These should be the moments of the DC electrodes, labelled from D1 to D10

- what about the RF electrodes?
- what about the two central DC electrodes running across x? Are they the 'shims'?
- wtf is x0?

There are also files for the electric fields and 2d data, I'll learn how to use them later
